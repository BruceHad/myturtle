<p>The string of commands I generated was based on a pattern called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve">Dragon Curve</a>. It's one of many patterns that can be generated using Lindenmayer System or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-system</a>.</p>
<p>L-Systems consist of alphabets of commands (like 'F' is the command for forward()). It starts with a basic string (the axiom) and a set of rules. These rules are repeatedly applied to the string to generate more and more complicated set of commands.</p>
<p>For a dragon curve you start with the axiom 'FX' then apply the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace F with null</li>
<li>Replace X with X+YF+</li>
<li>Replace Y with −FX−Y</li>
</ul>
<p>So the first few iterations look something like this:</p>
<p>0: FX
1: X+YF+
2: X+YF++−FX−Y+
3: X+YF++−FX−Y++−X+YF+−−FX−Y+</p>
<p>Where F stands for forward(), + stands for 'turn right' and - 'turn left'. (X and Y are used in the L-system but don't equate to any commands).</p>
