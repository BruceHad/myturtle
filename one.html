<h2>Turtles</h2>
<p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>. It was a truck with a keypad on it's back, and it could be programmed to follow a route...3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on. I didn't know at the time, but this was similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>, a programming method whereby a 'pen' is programmed to draw lines on a cartesian plane. Programming a truck is cool an' all, but turtles can draw pictures, which is better.</p>
<p>To work, a turtle needs three attributes: a location (generally x,y co-ordinates on a plane), an orientation (angle) and a pen.</p>
<p>The pen also has a number of attributes such as colour, width, pen up or down (i.e. draw or don't draw).</p>
<p>Turtle also needs a couple of actions: to move the turtle and rotate the orientation. Two actions shoudl be enough to do just about anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>forward(distance) - moves turtle forward by a distance</li>
<li>rotate(angle) - rotates orientation by set angle.</li>
</ul>
<p>But other actions can be built on top of those to simplify things when playing with the turtle.</p>
<p>And that's basically it. Though to implement this in javascript and actually draw shit I'm going to need to set up a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> and add some line drawing type functionality.</p>
