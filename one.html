<h2>Turtles</h2>
<p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>, which was a toy car that could be programmed with a route (3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on) and would then follow that route (until it crashed into the skirting boards).</p>
<p>To program something similar (aka a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>) you just needs to know a couple of actions: move and turn, while keeping track of current location and direction. With that you have a basic turtle.</p>
<pre><code>function Turtle(){
  var location = [0,0]; // Set starting location 
  var angle = 0; // Angle is in radians
  var canvas = new Canvas(); // Need a canvas to draw on
  this.rotate = function(anglePercent) {
    angle += anglePercent * Math.PI *2;
  };
  this.forward = function(dist) {
    newLocation = [location[0]+ Math.cos(angle) * dist, 
            location[1]+ Math.sin(angle) * dist];
    canvas.draw(location, newLocation, pen);
    location = [newLocation[0], newLocation[1]];
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>In order to do this on a webpage we need something like the HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> element and some code to help with drawing lines. Something like this works for me.</p>
<pre><code>function Canvas(canvasId) {
    var canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    var intId = null;
    var steps = 10;
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    var count = 0;
    this.draw = function(start, end, pen) {
        ctx.strokeStyle = pen.colour;
        ctx.lineWidth = pen.width;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(start[0], start[1]);
        ctx.lineTo(end[0], end[1]);
        ctx.stroke();
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add in a few basic controls and you've got the beginnings of a turtle to play with.</p>
