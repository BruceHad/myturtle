<p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>. It was a truck with a keypad on it's back, and it could be programmed to follow a route...3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on. </p>
<p>AKA a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>), to program one it just needs to know two bit of information: where it is and what direction it's facing. On top of that, it needs to know how to perform a couple of actions: move forward and rotate.</p>
<pre><code>function Turtle(){
  var location = [0.5,0.5]; // Half pixel offset
  var angle = 0; // Radians
  var pen = new Pen();
  var canvas = new Canvas();
  this.rotate = function(anglePercent) {
    // to simplify the maths anglePercent is a percentage of
    // a full circle. e.g to rotate turtle by 90 degrees == rotate(0.25).
    angle += anglePercent * Math.PI *2;
  };
  this.forward = function(dist) {
    pos2 = [location[0]+ Math.cos(angle) * dist, location[1]+ Math.sin(angle) * dist];
    if(pen.draw) canvas.draw(location, pos2, pen);
    location = [pos2[0], pos2[1]];
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's pretty much all the code that's needed for a turtle. Though in order two implement this in HTML/Javascript we need a pen and a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> with some line drawing capability. Something like this.</p>
<pre><code>function Pen() {
    var colour = '#000000';
    var width = 1;
    this.draw = true;
    this.pop = function() {
        draw = !draw
    };
};

function Canvas(canvasId) {
    var canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    var intId = null;
    var steps = 10;
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    var count = 0;
    this.draw = function(start, end, pen) {
        ctx.strokeStyle = pen.colour;
        ctx.lineWidth = pen.width;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(start[0], start[1]);
        ctx.lineTo(end[0], end[1]);
        ctx.stroke();
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I have added a few basic controls and animated the line drawing just for kicks.</p>
