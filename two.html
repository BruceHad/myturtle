<p>But that's just the beginning. The cool thing about the Big Trak was the ability to program in a course and let it go off on it's own.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is to set up a string of commands, each command mapping to an action e.g. F mean move forward. Then when we hit GO, the turtle reads each command in turn and follows the course set for it.</p>
<p>This is a nice way of doing things because it makes it quite easy for us to generate the command string, and therefore the path of the turtle, programmatically. For example, I generated the following string of command with a small program. Try copying it into the Command Window input below and hitting go.</p>
