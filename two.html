<h2>2. My Turtle 'Trak'</h2>
<p>But that's just the beginning. The cool thing about the Big Trak was the ability to program in a course and let it go off on it's own.</p>
<p>To add that in is fairly simple. We can use the controls to add commands to a string. Then when we hit GO, the turtle reads each command in turn and follows the course set for it.</p>
<p>This is a simple change but it introduces a whole range of new possibilies. The course of the turtle is set by this string we've introduced. And to get a bit meta, these strings themselves generated by programs or mathematical algorithms to produce some really nice images.</p>
