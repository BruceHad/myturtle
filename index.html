        <h2>Turtles</h2>
        <p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>. It was a truck with a keypad on it's back, and it could be programmed to follow a route...3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on. </p>
        <p>AKA a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>), to program one it just needs to know two bit of information: where it is and what direction it's facing. On top of that, it needs to know how to perform a couple of actions: move forward and rotate.</p>
        <pre><code>
function Turtle(){
  var location = [0.5,0.5]; // Half pixel offset
  var angle = 0; // Radians
  var pen = new Pen();
  var canvas = new Canvas();
  this.rotate = function(anglePercent) {
    // to simplify the maths anglePercent is a percentage of
    // a full circle. e.g to rotate turtle by 90 degrees == rotate(0.25).
    angle += anglePercent * Math.PI *2;
  };
  this.forward = function(dist) {
    pos2 = [location[0]+ Math.cos(angle) * dist, location[1]+ Math.sin(angle) * dist];
  if(pen.draw) canvas.draw(location, pos2, pen);
    location = [pos2[0], pos2[1]];
  };
}
        </code></pre>
  <p>And that's pretty much all the code that's needed for a turtle. Though in order two implement this in HTML/Javascript we need a pen and a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> with some line drawing capability. Something like this.</p>
  <pre><code>function Pen() {
    var colour = '#000000';
    var width = 1;
    this.draw = true;
    this.pop = function() {
    draw = !draw
  };
};

function Canvas(canvasId) {
var canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
var intId = null;
var steps = 10;
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
var count = 0;
this.draw = function(start, end, pen) {
ctx.strokeStyle = pen.colour;
ctx.lineWidth = pen.width;
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(start[0], start[1]);
ctx.lineTo(end[0], end[1]);
ctx.stroke();
};
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I have added a few basic controls and animated the line drawing just for kicks.</p>

  <h2>2. My Turtle 'Trak'</h2>
  <p>But that's just the beginning. The cool thing about the Big Trak was the ability to program in a course and let it go off on it's own.</p>
  <p>To add that in is fairly simple. We can use the controls to add commands to a string. Then when we hit GO, the turtle reads each command in turn and follows the course set for it.</p>
  <p>This is a simple change but it introduces a whole range of new possibilies. The course of the turtle is set by this string we've introduced. And to get a bit meta, these strings themselves generated by programs or mathematical algorithms to produce some really nice images.</p>
