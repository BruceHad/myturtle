                    <h2>Turtles</h2>
                    <p>Like a lot of 80s kids, my first introduction to programming was a toy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">Big Trak</a>. It was a truck with a keypad on it's back, and it could be programmed to follow a route...3 forward, turn right, reverse 5 and so on. I didn't know at the time, but this was similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle</a>, a programming method whereby a 'pen' is programmed to draw lines on a cartesian plane. Programming a truck is cool an' all, but turtles can draw pictures, which is better.</p>
                    <p>To work, a turtle needs three attributes: a location (generally x,y co-ordinates on a plane), an orientation (angle) and a pen.</p>
                    <p>Turtle also needs a couple of actions: to move the turtle and rotate the orientation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>forward(distance) - moves turtle forward by a distance</li>
                        <li>rotate(angle) - rotates orientation by set angle.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These two actions should be enough to do just about anything, but I could add more to make controls simpler.</p>
<pre><code>
function Turtle(){
    var location = [0.5,0.5]; // Half pixel offset
    var angle = 0; // Radians
    var pen = new Pen();
    var canvas = new Canvas();
    this.rotate = function(anglePercent) {
    // to simplify the maths anglePercent is a percentage of
    // a full circle. e.g to rotate turtle by 90 degrees == rotate(0.25).
    angle += anglePercent * Math.PI *2;
};
this.forward = function(dist) {
    pos2 = [location[0]+ Math.cos(angle) * dist, location[1]+ Math.sin(angle) * dist];
    if(pen.draw) canvas.draw(location, pos2, pen);
        location = [pos2[0], pos2[1]];
    };
}
</code></pre>
      <p>The pen also has a number of attributes such as colour, width, pen up or down (i.e. draw or don't draw).</p>
<pre><code>f
function Pen(){
    var colour = '#000000';
    var width = 1;
    this.draw = true;
    this.pop = function(){
        draw = !draw
    };
};
</code></pre>
<p>And that's basically it. Though to implement this in javascript and actually draw stuff I'm going to need to set up a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas</a> with some line drawing type functions.</p>
<pre><code>
function Canvas(){
  var canvas = document.getElementById('c');
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  this.draw = function(start, end, pen){
  ctx.strokeStyle = pen.colour;
  ctx.lineWidth = pen.width;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(start[0], start[1]);
  ctx.lineTo(end[0], end[1]);
  ctx.stroke();
};
}
</code></pre>
<p>At the moment you should just see a blank canvas but if you open your web browsers console you should be able to type in some commands to control the turtle.</p>
<pre><code>turtle.forward(100);
    turtle.rotate(1/8);
    turtle.forward(100);
</code></pre>
<p>etc...so it would be good to add a few controls for the turtle.</p>

    <h2>TurtleTrack</h2>
    <p>Now we've added a visible pen and some controls.</p>
    <p>The pen also has a number of attributes such as colour, width, pen up or down (i.e. draw or don't draw).</p>
    <pre><code>function Pen(){
      var colour = '#000000';

      this.draw = true;
      this.pop = function(){
